                <p> Dr Kwame Nkrumah (21 September 1909 â€“ 27 April 1972) was a Ghanaian politician and revolutionary.
                    He was the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana, 
                    having led the Gold Coast to independence from Britain in 1957. 
                    An influential advocate of pan-Africanism, 
                    Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity 
                    and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962.
                    After twelve years abroad pursuing higher education, 
                    developing his political philosophy and organizing with other diasporic pan-Africanists,
                     Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast to begin his political career as an advocate of national independence. 
                     He formed the Convention People's Party, which achieved rapid success through its unprecedented appeal to the common voter. 
                     He became Prime Minister in 1952 and retained the position when Ghana declared independence from Britain in 1957. 
                    In 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah President.
